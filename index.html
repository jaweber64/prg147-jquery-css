        <p>The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in
            Major League Baseball as a member club of the National League Central division. The team plays its home
            games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two
            Major League teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League
            (AL) Central division.</p>

        <p>The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago
            Cubs in 1903.[1]</p>

        <p>In 1906, the Cubs won a Major League record 116 games, finishing 116–36 and posted a modern-era record
            winning percentage of .763, before losing the World Series to the Chicago White Sox ("The Hitless Wonders")
            by four games to two. The Cubs won back-to-back World Series championships in 1907 and 1908, becoming the
            first Major League team to play in three consecutive World Series, and the first to win it twice. The team
            has appeared in a total of eleven World Series, most recently in 2016. The Cubs have not won the World
            Series in 108 years, and they had not won the National League pennant in 71 years until finally winning
            it in 2016,[2] both of which are record "droughts" in Major League Baseball.[3][4] Since the start of
            divisional play in 1969, the Cubs have appeared in the postseason eight times. This included five trips
            to the League Championship Series—in 1984, 1989, 2003, 2015, and 2016 which they won.[2]</p>

        <p>The Cubs are known as "the North Siders", a reference to the location of Wrigley Field within the city of
            Chicago, and in contrast to the White Sox, whose home field (U.S. Cellular Field) is on the South Side. The
            Cubs have a divisional rivalry with the St. Louis Cardinals, and an interleague rivalry with the
            Chicago White Sox.</p>
